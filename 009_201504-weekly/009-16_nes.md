The link below contains hundreds of screenshots that were generated
automatically by loading a ROM, emulating for a few seconds and then saving
the screen.

### Usage

    go get github.com/fogleman/nes
    nes <rom_file.nes>

The `go get` command will automatically fetch the dependencies listed below,
compile the binary and place it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

### Dependencies

    github.com/go-gl/gl/v2.1/gl
    github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.1/glfw
    code.google.com/p/portaudio-go/portaudio

### Controls

Joysticks are supported, although the button mapping is currently hard-coded.
Keyboard controls are indicated below.

| Nintendo              | Emulator    |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Up, Down, Left, Right | Arrow Keys  |
| Start                 | Enter       |
| Select                | Right Shift |
| A                     | Z           |
| B                     | X           |
| A (Turbo)             | A           |
| B (Turbo)             | S           |
| Reset                 | R           |

### Mappers

The following mappers have been implemented:

* NROM (0)
* MMC1 (1)
* UNROM (2)
* CNROM (3)
* MMC3 (4)
* AOROM (7)

These mappers cover about 85% of all NES games. I hope to implement more
mappers soon. To see what games should work, consult this list:

### Known Issues

* there are some minor issues with PPU timing, but most games work OK anyway
* the APU emulation isn't quite perfect, but not far off
